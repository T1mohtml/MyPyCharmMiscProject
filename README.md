## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to download, set up, and run the projects locally:

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/T1mohtml/All-my-pycharm-projects.git
cd All-my-pycharm-projects
```

### 2. (Optional) Create a virtual environment
It's a good idea to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

```bash
# Create virtual environment (Windows)
python -m venv venv

# Or (Mac/Linux)
python3 -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment
# Windows
venv\Scripts\activate

# Mac/Linux
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install required Python packages
Install all dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file (if available):

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
